# Chatbot Basic

Welcome to the Chatbot Basic project, a Python-based conversational bot that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and response generation.

---

## Overview

This project implements a simple retrieval-based chatbot using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity algorithms. It's designed to process user inputs and provide relevant responses based on the similarity of previously uploaded text files.

---

## Features

- **Text Processing:** Utilizes NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text tokenization, lemmatization, and stop words removal.
- **Vectorization:** Implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text into numerical representations.
- **Response Generation:** Employs cosine similarity to retrieve the most relevant response from the provided text corpus.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: NLTK and scikit-learn (`pip install nltk scikit-learn`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `chatbot_basic.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

---

## Usage

1. **Upload Text Files:** Use the provided code to upload text files containing conversational data.
2. **Interact with the Bot:** Start a conversation by typing 'Hi' and end it with 'Bye'.
3. **Enhance and Experiment:** Feel free to modify or expand the bot's capabilities by tweaking the code or adding more functionalities.
